# Description
  The intention of this challenge was to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees based on the user's input and generates an HTML webpage that displays the team roster showing summaries of each person. This application prompts the user for information about the team members headed by the team manager. The user can add as many team members as he/she wishes.
  This application is also run through a series of unit tests to ensure that information of each team member is generated according to the stipulated format.
